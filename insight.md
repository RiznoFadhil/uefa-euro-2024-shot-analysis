# 2️⃣ Top Teams by Total xG — Attacking Volume

## 🔎 Main insight

![Total xG](insight_images/top_total_xG.png)

Portugal leads the total xG significantly (~14.7), followed by France, Spain, and England.

### What does it means?

Total xG = **volume of attacks + consistency of creating chances**.

### Observation:

* Portugal is the most aggressive attacking team.
* Spain and England have almost the same xG total → maybe similar offensive performance.
* Netherlands, Turkey, Austria, and Croatia are in the '**second tier**'.

👉 Portugal will likely play a style of play:

* high possession
* lots of build-up
* high shooting frequency

But important:
👉 High total xG ≠ good finishing.

## 🔎 Main insight

Team with the best 'shot quality':

🥇 Portugal
🥈 Slovenia
🥉 Georgia

🏅 Switzerland & Croatia

Spain **isn't in top 10 for shot quality** although they're **third** in total xG.
That means Spain created many chances and relies more on sustained attacking volume rather than elite shot quality per attempt.
