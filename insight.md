## 🔎 Main insight

![Shot Map for Spain vs Germany](insight_images/shot_map_qf.png)

Even though Germany had **more total shots (23)** than Spain (19), the quality of Spain's chances looked more dangerous in the penalty area.

### Visual observation:

* Spain's shots (blue) are more concentrated **near the goal** with a higher xG than shots outside the penalty area.
* Germany (green) had a lot of shots from longer distances.
* Spain scored **2 goals from 1.53 xG**, while Germany only **1 goal from 1.63 xG**.

✅ Spain generated **fewer shots** but concentrated their attempts **inside penalty area** with **high-value** xG, indicating a more efficient attacking structure compared to Germany.

![Total vs average xG](insight_images/total_vs_avg_xG.png)

Based on these plots, we can get some interesting insight about how teams create their attack.

* Spain - High-volume, low-efficiency attack
> Spain has the highest total shots in the tournament, with 123 shots that convert to 10.57 xG. This makes Spain creates 0.0859 xG in each shot, which isn't in the top 10. It means that Spain relies more on continuous attacking and create more of not-so-great-chances than elite chances.

* France vs Germany — Similar volume, different efficiency
> France and Germany are similar in total shot created (101 and 95, respectively), but France creates significantly more xG than Germany (12.11 vs 8.72). There's a possibility that France creates more 'elite chances' than Germany and create less 'bad chances' too.

* Portugal — High-volume, high-efficiency attack
> Portugal is the **outlier** of the tournament. They lead the tournament in total and average xG (14.71 and 0.154, respectively) while also become top 5 in total shots created (95). This means Portugal is not only shooting frequently, but also creating more 'elite chances' and maintaining optimal shot selection despite the increased volume. In this tournament, they're the **elite** attacking team.

* Netherlands & Turkey — High-volume, not-elite output
> The Netherlands (83 shots) and Turkey (72 shots) had a fairly high volume, but having average xG below elite teams. This become correlated to their Total xG that disproportionate to the number of shots they've created (7.32 and 6.46, respectively). This shows both team create many attempts, but the quality of the chances is less than optimal. 

* Switzerland — Low-volume, high-efficiency
> Switzerland only creates 62 shots in the tournament, it still placed them in top 8 but there's a huge gap between them and Spain(123) and France(101), but those 62 shots converted to 8.48 xG (top 6) and averages 0.137 xG (number 4, yes, you're eyes aren't lie to you, they're number 4 in average xG).
> Let's compare them to the champions, Spain. Spain(123) creates twice as many chances as Switzerland. But, Switzerland converts their shots to xG better, and I mean quite-a-lot better than Spain (0.137 vs 0.086). This shows us that both of them has different approach in attacking. Spain create sustained attacking chances, when Switzerland are more selective in creating chances to make sure they create more 'elite chances'.

# 🚀 Summary

* The analysis reveals that attacking strength in EURO 2024 is not solely defined by total xG. Teams like Portugal demonstrate a balanced attacking profile combining both volume and shot quality, while Spain relies more heavily on sustained attacking pressure rather than elite shot selection.
